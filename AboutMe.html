          Have you ever had a passion? A hobby that you loved, and want to do as an adult? There are millions of people worldwide who know how it feels to aspire for something, but few get to do what they enjoy. Startup companies are a solution to that. Startup companies, or startups, can ensure you’re doing what you love with people you love. However, it’s not always easy. Around ninety percent of startups fail, and it’s important to be knowledgeable with investing and business. That’s why I’m glad I got to experience what it’s like to start a company at X.O.R. Data.
  	When we first arrived at X.O.R. Data, I was very surprised. I had expected the field trip to be about coding, not business and investing and stocks. I wasn’t very excited, to be honest. When I got inside, I was shocked. There was so much more to investing than I had thought! It was very interesting to learn about all the different pieces you needed to run a successful startup. I had a lot of fun creating a product for the Shark Tank activity, and I learned a lot.
  	For example, I learned about how different investors are useful at different stages of development. This information can be useful because investors are a very big part of starting a business. If I decide to form a startup, I’ll need to know which investors I want to look into and which investors to wait for. I also learned about marketing and products. This is important because it helps cut down on extra materials in businesses. When a product doesn’t sell, it’s important to remove or revise it.
  My experience at X.O.R. Data was very helpful. I learned a lot of useful information, and I had fun while doing it. It was interesting to learn about something I wasn’t very knowledgeable in- investing. I think that everybody should have the chance to experience something like what I got to learn	 at X.O.R. Data. Basic business and marketing is important, and I would like to go back again.
  In conclusion, I think what I learned at X.O.R. Data is very valuable. I enjoyed being there, and would definitely like to go back. People sometimes underestimate startups, and even though they’re rare, successful startups are certainly something to watch for. Remember, just search for your passion in life. Do what makes you happy, and find your spark.
